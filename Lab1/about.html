    <em>clay by dallin</em>. It all started with a lump of clay and a love for adventure-- trying to use my life and experiences to
    inspire my art..</p>

    <div class = "about-words"> <p class= "words"> I started studying ceramic art in highschool, and while I certainly was no prodigy,
      I immediately fell in love. I took the class as many times as I could during the school year, and during the summer months I maintained
      a membership at a local studio. I wanted to learn everything I could about pottery.</p>

  <div class = "about-container">
    <div class = "about-words"> <p class= "words">After graduating, I had some important decisions to make. Was pottery really going to be able
    to support the kind of lifestyle I wanted? Would I be able to make enough money to pay rent? Unfortunately, I decided that pottery was
    probably something that I should only do as a hobby, so I stopped creating. This story, however, has a happy ending! After several years of doing pottery
    off and on, I realized that I wasn't ever going to be able to quit. I spoke with some mentors and dear friends of mine, and I got the courage I needed to
  take my artwork to the next step. I know work as an instructor and a studio here in northern Utah, and I'm loving every minute of it. I still have the ability to
  work on my own pieces, while sharing this part of me with others.</p>
